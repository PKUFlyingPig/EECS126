    "In this lab, we'll be studying Interactive Particle Systems (IPS). IPS is a good model for understanding the behaviour of agents in a world and can be viewed as an extension of Markov chains. In a Markov chain, the key is the Markov property, which tells us that the next time step only depends on our current state. This is true in an IPS model as well.\n",

    "To be more concrete, in this lab, we'll try to understand how biological evolution is affected by things such as the rate of mutations, the environment, etc. To do so, we'll setup a world and treat organisms as particles. At each step, these organisms may reproduce, compete each with other, etc.  \n",

    "Before, we setup our IPS model, however, first we'll create our world. But, how do we generate elevations that look realistic? A lot of research has been poured into this, and one method which has been successful is Perlin noise [(Wikipedia)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perlin_noise) [(Blog)](https://flafla2.github.io/2014/08/09/perlinnoise.html). It is used in both animated movies and Minecraft, and in this portion, we'll see how to implement it. Below you will find perlin noise in 1, 2, and 3 dimensions.\n",
