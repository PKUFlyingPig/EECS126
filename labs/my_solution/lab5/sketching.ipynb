    "Sketching is an efficient matrix computation technique from randomized linear algebra with a wide range of applications like low-rank approximation, least squares, etc. During sketching, a large matrix is compressed into a smaller matrix by multiplying it by a random matrix. The smaller matrix can be then used as a proxy for the large matrix for efficient (but approximate) computation. In this lab, we will look at sketching-based multiplication of two large matrices."
