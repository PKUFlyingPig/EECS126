    "## Developing Metropolis Hastings (MH)\n",
    "\n",
    "Our task is to define a set of transition and acceptance probabilities so that we have an aperiodic Markov Chain whose stationary distribution $\\pi(x)$ is equal to our target distribution $P(x)$. The MH algorithm does this implicitly by defining a procedure for transitioning between states. However, it has some assumptions. In particular, it assumes that you can compute:\n",
    "\n",
    "- $f(x)$, **a directly proportional estimate** of $P(x)$, i.e. $P(x) = \\frac{f(x)}{\\sum_{y \\in \\mathcal{X}} f(y)}$.\n",
    "- $g(x, \\cdot)$, a proposal distribution for the next state, where $x$ is your current state.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note: $g(x, \\cdot)$ can be arbitrary in terms of the $f(x)$ (e.g. N(0,1)) and achieve the same stationary distribution, but generally proposal functions have to be tuned on a per-case basis in order to visualize a good result in a reasonable amount of time).\n",
    "\n",
    "The MH algorithm says, at each time step:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Propose the next candidate state $y$ according $g(x,\\cdot)$.\n",
    "- Accept $y$, with probability $A(x,y) = min\\{1, \\frac{f(y)g(y,x)}{f(x)g(x,y)}\\}$.\n",
    "- If you accept the proposal, transition to $y$. Otherwise, stay in $x$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Following this procedure, the stationary distribution of the implicitly defined Markov Chain will be $P(x)$. Thus you can take a random walk to sample from $P(x)$. However, in practice, the following two extensions are made:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Taking every step-th state in the random walk. This helps reduce the dependence between samples.\n",

We will look at this in the context of distributions with two peaks (two separated regions of high probability), also known as bimodal distributions. We will see that the peaks may not be sampled appropriately.\n",

    "A mixture of Gaussians is obtained when you have two subpopulations ('classes') each distributed normally($\\mathcal{N}(\\mu_1,\\sigma_1^2)$ and $\\mathcal{N}(\\mu_2,\\sigma_2^2)$) . An example is heights of people with the subclasses of men and women. In the mixture model the 'classes' have probabilities $p$ and $1-p$ respectively. So the pdf of this distribution would be $$p\\cdot f_X(x\\ |\\text{ class 1}) + (1-p)\\cdot f_X(x\\ |\\text{ class 2}) = p\\cdot \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2\\pi \\sigma_1^2}} e^{-\\frac{(x - \\mu_1)^2}{2\\sigma_1^2}} + (1-p)\\cdot \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2\\pi \\sigma_2^2}} e^{-\\frac{(x - \\mu_2)^2}{2\\sigma_2^2}}\n",

There are exact conditions for this you can look up if you are interested. \n",

You should see that one of the peaks dominates (could be either one) as the standard deviation reduces even though both classes have an equal probability. For low std devs 2 and 1, only one peak should show up. What effect do you think changing the standard deviation has? What possible disadvantage of MH does this bimodal distribution show?\n",
