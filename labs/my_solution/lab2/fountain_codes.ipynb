    "## Introduction \n",
    "\n",
    "When sending packets of data over a communication channel such as the internet or a radio channel, packets often get erased. Because of this, packets must be sent under some erasure code such that the data can still be recovered. In CS 70, you may have learned about an erasure code that involves embedding the data in a polynomial, and then sampling points from that polynomial. There, we assumed that there were at most $k$ erasures in the channel. This week, we'll explore a different channel model in which each packet independently has a probability $p$ of being erased. In particular, this lab will look at random bipartite graphs (the balls and bins model).\n",
    "\n",
    "A little more on the channel and the erasure code; formally, our channel is called the binary erasure channel (BEC), where bits that are sent through a noisy channel either make it through unmodified or are tagged as \"corrupt\", in which case the received information is dropped in all further information processing steps. Here's an image that shows what happens:\n",

    "\n",
    "If we wanted to convey a message, we could consider a feedback channel in which the receiver tells the sender which messages were received and the sender re-sends the dropped packets. This process can be repeated until the receiver gets all of the intended message. While this procedure is indeed optimal in all senses of the word, feedback is simply not possible in many circumstances. If Netflix is trying to stream a show chunked into $n$ data chunks to a million people, its servers can't process all the feedback from the users. Thus, Netflix must use a method independent of feedback. If they use near-optimal codes to encode and constantly send out the same random chunks of the video's data to all users, then they can be sure that users get what they need in only a little more than $n$ transmissions *no matter what parts of the show each individual user lost through their specific channel*!\n",
    "\n",
    "So what's the secret to this magic?  It's a two step process of clever encoding and decoding:"

   "source": [
    "### Encoding\n",
    "1. Suppose your data can be divided into $n$ chunks. First, pick an integer $d$ ($1 \\leq d \\leq n$) according to some distribution.\n",
    "2. With $d$ picked, now select $d$ random chunks of the data and combine their binary representations together using the XOR operator.\n",
    "3. Transmit these chunks, along with the metadata telling which actual chunk indices were XOR'd, as a packet. If a packet is erased, both the chunks it contains and the chunk indices would be lost. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Decoding\n",
    "1. For each packet that has been received, check if it only contains one chunk, in which case the packet is exactly equal to the single chunk it contains. If not, we can check if any of the chunks in the packet are already known, in which case XOR that chunk with the packet and remove it from the list of chunk indices that make up the packet.\n",
    "3. If there are two or more indices in the list left for the packet, we cannot figure out any more information!  Put it on the side for looking at later.\n",
    "4. With any newly decoded information, we may be able to decode previously undecodable packets that we had put on the side.  Go through all unsolved packets and try to decode more packets until nothing more can be done.\n",
    "5. Wait for the next packet to come and repeat!\n",
    "\n",
    "Now what's left for you to do?  Well, remember that number $d$?  It needs to be picked according to some distribution, and which distribution is the million dollar question!\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example\n",
    "<center><img src=\"bipartite.png\" style=\"width: 300px;\"> </center>\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider the above bipartite graph. Here, the right square nodes represent the packets, and the left circular nodes represent the data chunks ($X_i, i=1,..,4$). There is an edge from a packet to a chunk if the packet contains that chunk. Let's try decoding the packets chronologically.\n",
    "1. Since the first packet contains only the third data chunk, we are able to immediately resolve it and find that $X_3=1$.\n",
    "2. The second packet contains the second and third chunks XOR'd together. Since we already know the third chunk, we can XOR the third chunk ($X_3=1$) with the data packet (0) to get the value of the second data chunk, $X_2=1$.\n",
    "3. The third packet contains the XOR of data chunks 1, 2, and 4. We have already determined chunks 2 and 3, so we are able to XOR 2 from this packet, but are still left with 1 and 4, and so must move on.\n",
    "4. With the arrival of the fourth packet, we are able to resolve everything: data chunks 2 and 3 are already determined, and so we are able to XOR chunk 3 ($X_3=1$) with this new data packet (1) to get the value of the chunk 4, $X_4=0$. With this new information, we are able to resolve $X_1$, as packet 3 gave us the equation $1 = X_1 \\oplus X_2 \\oplus X_4 = X_1 \\oplus 1 \\oplus 0$. We can solve this to get $X_1 = 0$.\n",
    "5. We have now solved for all the data chunks, with $X_1 = 0, X_2 = 1, X_3 = 1, X_4 = 0$.\n",
    "\n",
    "As you might be able to tell, by choosing a good degree distribution for $d$, even when random incoming packets were lost (not shown), you were still able to recover all $4$ symbols only from $4$ received packets, despite the sender not knowing what packets you lost through the BEC."

You, the Chief Technology Officer of Netflix, know that given the heavy workload of EECS 126, this may be your only chance to convert this freeloading customer into a permanent one, but to do so you're going to have to make sure her viewing experience is perfect.\n",
