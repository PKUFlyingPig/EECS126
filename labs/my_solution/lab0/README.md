# Installation

Our labs use Jupyter. The recommended way to install it is by installing
Anaconda, an all-in-one distribution that comes with Python, Jupyter, and many
other useful packages.

Download the installers at https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/, and follow
the instructions at https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/ to set it up.
Choose the latest version of Python.

One thing to note is that we want Anaconda to reside in our home directory.
However, this means that we may needs to add its bin folder to our PATH
variable.

Each lab may require imported packages that you may or may not have installed already.
We suggest maintaining a conda environment for EECS126 labs, and collecting the necessary 
packages into that environment for each new lab.
